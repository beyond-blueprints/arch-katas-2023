# Native App vs PWA

## Status

ACCEPTED

## Context

The advantages of a mobile application are significant in providing the richest and optimized experience to the user beyond the capabilities of a web browser. However, the development of a native mobile application poses a challenge, necessitating the formation of an additional team proficient in native languages for various platforms. This would incur supplementary costs and impact overall time of  the project, which warrants careful consideration in aligning with project objectives and budget constraints.

### Decision

PWA for MVP and moving to Native App as a long term strategy.

### Consequences
- Will avoid supplementary costs and PWA will still allow user to use the Trip Management Features.
